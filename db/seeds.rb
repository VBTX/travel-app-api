# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# anaheim = Location.create(city: "Anaheim", state: "California", country: "USA")
# disney = anaheim.attractions.create(name: "Disneyland", description: "Happiest place on earth!")
# victoria = User.create(name: "Victoria", username: "Victoria", password: "password") NEEDED HOMETOWN
# victoria_disney= victoria.trips.create(start_date: "2019-07-18", end_date: "2019-07-28")
# victoria_disney.visits.create(attraction: disney, date: "2019-07-18")
